# SOC on ML and GAME THEORY

## Assignments

### Assignment 1
1. Simplex method to solve linear programs
2. Solving Quadratic Solvers
3. Inverse Transform Sampling
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
5. Curve Fitting

### Assignment 2
Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to obtain the governing ordinary differential equation for the evolution of the population of two creatures, the data of which is provided in the means of a CSV file. We train and validate the model using 3 different splits, displaying the Mean Squared Error (MSE) when compared to the actual data.

## Mid-Term Project
This project revolves around enhancing the quality of transformer current data sampled every 5 minutes, sourced from a solar power generation site. The dataset likely contains fluctuations, anomalies, and missing values due to various factors such as weather conditions, equipment malfunctions, or measurement errors. 

Our objective is to identify 'good', 'bad', and 'missing' days within this dataset and improve the quality of the data by addressing inconsistencies and filling in missing values. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a model using data from the identified 'good' days to learn patterns and relationships, which will then be validated and utilized to enhance the quality of data from 'bad' and 'missing' days. Through this process, we intend to provide a more reliable dataset for analysis and decision-making in the context of solar power generation.
